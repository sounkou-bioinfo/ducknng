# ducknng body codec providers

`ducknng` keeps transport bytes, protocol frames, and method payloads separate. The body codec provider layer is the opt-in serialization/deserialization layer for raw HTTP bodies and other content-type-tagged `BLOB` values. It is inspired by `nanonext` serialization providers, but it is keyed by media type instead of R object class and it is not part of the framed RPC method registry.

The raw HTTP primitives remain `ducknng_ncurl(...)` and its async companion `ducknng_ncurl_aio(...)` / `ducknng_ncurl_aio_collect(...)`. They return status, headers, `body BLOB`, and a best-effort UTF-8 `body_text` column without interpreting the response by `Content-Type`. Parsed body behavior is explicit:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ducknng_list_codecs();
SELECT * FROM ducknng_parse_body(body, content_type);
SELECT * FROM ducknng_ncurl_table(url, method, headers_json, body, timeout_ms, tls_config_id);
```

`ducknng_parse_body(...)` parses an existing `BLOB` using the supplied content type. `ducknng_ncurl_table(...)` performs one HTTP/HTTPS request, requires a 2xx response status, extracts the response `Content-Type`, and parses the response body into a DuckDB table. Use `ducknng_ncurl(...)` instead when you need to inspect non-2xx responses, response headers, or raw bytes.

The initial built-in providers are deliberately conservative. Unknown or missing content types fall back to raw `BLOB` output. `text/*` bodies are exposed as `VARCHAR` only when the bytes are valid UTF-8 text. `application/vnd.ducknng.frame` is decoded with the same envelope shape as `ducknng_decode_frame(...)`. Arrow IPC stream bytes are decoded through nanoarrow and the same stable manual DuckDB vector mapping used by `ducknng_query_rpc(...)`.

JSON bodies are parsed in memory through DuckDB's JSON scalar functions (`json_structure(...)` and `from_json(...)`) and then serialized through the existing Arrow IPC row mapping before returning rows to the caller. This avoids temporary files while still letting DuckDB own JSON type inference and conversion.

CSV, TSV, and Parquet are recognized media types but do not have parsing providers enabled yet. DuckDB's standard CSV and Parquet readers are path/file-system oriented; using them efficiently for BLOB bodies needs a scalarfs-style memory filesystem or a stable C extension hook that can expose an in-memory file to DuckDB readers. Until that lands, these media types use the generic `body BLOB` fallback instead of spilling to temporary files.

JSON parsing currently fails fast inside service-owned SQL, such as SQL executed through remote `exec` / `ducknng_query_rpc(...)`, because that path already owns the same runtime init-connection execution gate on the current request thread. Raw, text, CSV/TSV/Parquet fallback, frame, and direct Arrow IPC decoding do not need a nested DuckDB query. Lifting the JSON limitation requires a broader per-session/per-request connection model rather than re-entering the shared init connection from inside an active request.

User-extensible body codecs are part of the v1 surface through `ducknng_register_codec(content_type, function_name)` and `ducknng_unregister_codec(content_type)`. The contract is deliberately narrow: `function_name` must be a plain SQL identifier (ASCII letter/underscore start, then alphanumeric/underscore/dot only — no semicolons, parentheses, or expression syntax) naming a single-argument scalar function whose argument type is `BLOB` and whose return type is `VARCHAR`. The codec layer dispatches by splicing the identifier into a fixed `SELECT <fn>(?::BLOB) AS value` shape, so the parsed table for a user codec is always a single-row, single-column `value VARCHAR` result. Returning `NULL` is allowed and surfaces as a `NULL` row.

User codecs take precedence over built-ins when their content type matches, so registering a hook for `application/json` overrides the built-in JSON parser for as long as it is registered. Content-type matching is case-insensitive and tolerates parameters such as `; charset=utf-8`. Unregistering an unknown content type returns `FALSE` rather than erroring; unregistering a registered hook restores the built-in behavior. `ducknng_list_codecs()` reports the registered user hook with `kind = 'user'` and the SQL function name in the `function_name` column alongside the built-in providers.

User codecs run through the runtime's shared init connection, which means they are subject to the same service-owned SQL execution gate as the built-in JSON provider: they fail fast inside service-owned SQL such as `ducknng_query_rpc(...)` execution. That keeps the dispatch path predictable and avoids re-entering the init connection from inside an active request. Lifting that limitation requires the broader per-session/per-request connection model rather than a codec-layer change.

The HTTP server RPC endpoint does not use this provider layer to accept arbitrary web payloads. `ducknng_start_http_server(...)` still accepts only `POST` requests whose body is one complete `application/vnd.ducknng.frame` envelope. The provider layer is for local parsing and client-side HTTP convenience, not a second server protocol.

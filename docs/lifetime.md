# Lifetime and manual resource management

`ducknng` is a low-level DuckDB binding to NNG plus an Arrow IPC-based RPC framework. That means lifetime rules matter, both inside the extension and at the SQL surface.

This document separates the two.

## 1. What DuckDB does give the extension

DuckDB's C extension API does provide destroy callbacks for extension-owned state that is tied to function registration or statement execution.

Examples include:

- scalar-function extra info via `duckdb_scalar_function_set_extra_info(..., destroy)`
- scalar-function bind data via `duckdb_scalar_function_set_bind_data(..., destroy)`
- table-function extra info via `duckdb_table_function_set_extra_info(..., destroy)`
- table-function bind data via `duckdb_bind_set_bind_data(..., destroy)`
- table-function init data via `duckdb_init_set_init_data(..., destroy)`
- aggregate destructors and similar callback-driven internal cleanup points

That is enough for extension-internal lifetime management of:

- registered function context objects
- bind-time objects
- init-time objects
- statement-local execution state

`ducknng` already uses those callback hooks for internal cleanup.

## 2. What DuckDB does not give us at the SQL-handle level

DuckDB SQL does **not** give `ducknng` a general-purpose GC/finalizer model for user-visible handles like R's external pointer finalizers.

In particular, there is no general SQL-level hook that says:

- this returned `UBIGINT` handle is no longer referenced anywhere
- this handle should be finalized automatically at end of user scope
- this object should be dropped when a variable or temp table cell becomes unreachable

So while DuckDB helps with extension-internal callback-owned state, it does **not** give `ducknng` a `nanonext`-style automatic finalizer story for long-lived SQL-visible runtime handles.

That is why `ducknng` has explicit cleanup functions.

## 3. Manual cleanup the user should do

If you create long-lived runtime objects from SQL, you should clean them up explicitly.

### Servers

If you start a server with `ducknng_start_server(...)`, stop it with:

- `ducknng_stop_server(name)`

Do not rely on database shutdown as the normal cleanup path for long-lived sessions or tests.

### Sockets

If you open a socket with `ducknng_open_socket(...)`, close it with:

- `ducknng_close_socket(socket_id)`

This applies to `req`, `rep`, `pair`, `poly`, `push`, `pull`, `pub`, `sub`, `surveyor`, `respondent`, and the other exposed generic protocols.

### AIO handles

If you launch an aio with:

- `ducknng_request_raw_aio(...)`
- `ducknng_request_socket_raw_aio(...)`
- `ducknng_send_socket_raw_aio(...)`
- `ducknng_recv_socket_raw_aio(...)`
- `ducknng_get_rpc_manifest_raw_aio(...)`
- `ducknng_run_rpc_raw_aio(...)`

then you should eventually release the aio handle explicitly with:

- `ducknng_aio_drop(aio_id)`

Important:

- `ducknng_aio_cancel(aio_id)` requests cancellation, but it is **not** the destructor
- `ducknng_aio_collect(...)` collects terminal results, but it does **not** auto-free the aio slot
- dropping the aio handle is still the explicit cleanup step

### TLS config handles

If you create TLS config handles with:

- `ducknng_tls_config_from_files(...)`
- `ducknng_tls_config_from_pem(...)`
- `ducknng_self_signed_tls_config(...)`

then drop them when done with:

- `ducknng_drop_tls_config(tls_config_id)`

Note that `tls_config_id = 0` is the public sentinel for plaintext/no TLS config. It is not an allocated handle and does not need dropping.

### Query sessions

If you open a query session with:

- `ducknng_open_query(...)`

keep both the returned `session_id` and `session_token`, then close it explicitly with:

- `ducknng_close_query(...)`

If you need to stop work early, use:

- `ducknng_cancel_query(...)`

but treat `cancel` as best-effort control, not as a universal destructor guarantee. The normal session cleanup path is still explicit close unless the server clearly reports otherwise.

## 4. What runtime teardown still does for you

`ducknng` runtime teardown is still important, and recent hardening work improved it substantially.

When the runtime is destroyed, it now cleans up its owned structures rather than leaving destruction partial. That includes runtime-owned registries and transport/service state.

But that is fallback/runtime teardown behavior. It is **not** a substitute for explicit user-level cleanup in a long-lived database process, test suite, notebook, or interactive session.

## 5. Practical rule of thumb

Treat `ducknng` like a low-level systems binding:

- if you **start** a server, you should **stop** it
- if you **open** a socket, you should **close** it
- if you **launch** an aio, you should **drop** it
- if you **create** a TLS config, you should **drop** it
- if you **open** a query session, you should **close** it

That explicit lifecycle is the honest current API contract.

## 6. Relation to API hardening

The recent lifetime pass improved internal destruction and ownership correctness, but API hardening is not finished.

The main remaining lifetime-adjacent sealing blockers are still:

- final decision on whether the current `session_token` bearer capability is the sealed ownership model or whether broader transport/RPC authentication must land first
- any remaining borrowed-pointer or concurrent-handle edge cases that should be eliminated before calling the API sealed
- clear documentation of which resources are user-managed and which are statement-local/internal

That is why this document exists and why the README now links to it directly.

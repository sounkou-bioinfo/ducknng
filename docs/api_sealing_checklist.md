# ducknng API sealing checklist

This checklist is narrower than `docs/design_review_checklist.md`. It tracks what still blocks calling the current public API sealed or stable enough that public names, contracts, and examples should stop changing casually.

## Current position

`ducknng` already has a real public surface for:

- service lifecycle control
- method registry administration
- raw request/reply helpers
- generic NNG socket patterns
- raw aio handles
- the first raw unary RPC aio wrappers
- query-session control helpers
- TLS config handles
- an HTTP/HTTPS server helper plus URL-routed synchronous request/RPC/session helpers
- NNG WebSocket transport schemes through `ws://` and `wss://`
- a low-level HTTP/HTTPS client helper
- built-in content-type driven body codec helpers for raw/text/JSON/Arrow IPC/frame bodies, with CSV/TSV/Parquet recognized and using the generic `body BLOB` fallback pending a memory-backed reader path

That is enough for serious use and interop work, but it is not yet enough to call the full API sealed.

## Must-resolve before sealing

### 1. Session ownership and execution-lane policy review

The previous bare-`session_id` ownership blocker is addressed and the current query-family ownership model is the stable public contract: `query_open` returns a session-scoped bearer `session_token`, and `fetch`, `close`, and `cancel` must present it with the session id. Transport-derived mTLS identity is an additional owner constraint when present: sessions opened with a verified peer identity are bound to that identity as well as to the token. Exact verified-peer allowlists, IP/CIDR allowlists, descriptor auth, listener-wide mTLS, and SQL authorizers are deployment admission and policy layers around that session contract. Envelope-level RPC authentication may be added later as an additive application-auth layer, but it is not required to seal the current session ownership model and must not weaken token or mTLS owner checks.

The current service execution model is a single serialized DuckDB execution lane backed by the runtime init connection. That is no longer treated as an automatic sealing blocker: deployments can scale or isolate work by using multiple DuckDB contexts, multiple `ducknng` services or instances, or an upstream router. Free-form `exec` and query-session SQL are intentionally deployment-owned capabilities rather than an automatic sandbox; the remaining sealing work is to keep `ducknng`'s own generated SQL injection-safe and document clear deployment profiles for local, trusted-mesh, shared-client, and public/untrusted settings. Per-session or per-request DuckDB connections remain a possible hard-isolation mode for deployments that need it, not the only acceptable sealed posture.

### 2. Resource quotas for multi-client services

The current implementation enforces the stable baseline quotas: listener receive-size limits, descriptor request/reply-size limits, service-level session idle timeout, a service-level `max_open_sessions` cap, an NNG `max_active_pipes` cap, a carrier-neutral `max_inflight_requests` cap, and an mTLS-owner `max_sessions_per_peer_identity` cap set with `ducknng_set_service_limits(...)`; `query_open` replies expose the server-owned effective `idle_timeout_ms`, and the manifest exposes server-owned session policy including `max_open_sessions` and `max_sessions_per_peer_identity`. In the current stable model, quota owners are the service itself and, for the identity cap, the verified peer identity. The SQL-authorizer `principal` column is deployment policy/audit metadata rather than durable session ownership metadata. Future explicit limits for per-pipe/principal in-flight requests, principal-based open-session caps, cumulative reply bytes per owner, and session-open rate are additive hardening work rather than blockers for the current API contract.

### 3. Fetch payload decoding stance

Fetched Arrow payloads are decodable today through the body codec table path: store the `payload` BLOB returned by `ducknng_fetch_query(...)` and call `ducknng_parse_body(payload, 'application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream')`. That keeps `ducknng_fetch_query(...)` explicit about session control metadata while reusing the same Arrow IPC decoder used for body codecs. A later `ducknng_fetch_query_table(...)` convenience wrapper may be added, but it is not required to seal the current contract.

### 4. HTTP async and web-server framework scope

The HTTP transport direction is now in place:

- `ducknng_start_http_server(...)` is implemented
- the existing synchronous request/RPC/session helpers route over `http://` and `https://`
- `ducknng_ncurl_aio(...)` and `ducknng_ncurl_aio_collect(...)` provide the raw asynchronous HTTP/HTTPS client counterpart to `ducknng_ncurl(...)`

The remaining HTTP question is the broader server framework: the current server is a non-blocking NNG HTTP server that mounts one framed RPC handler; a later web-toolkit layer may add explicit route handlers, static responses, or SQL-backed handlers, but it must not create path-specific copies of existing RPC methods. The key constraint remains unchanged: HTTP must stay a carrier for the same manifest methods, session lifecycle, and Arrow-versus-JSON payload rules unless a separate web-framework surface is designed and documented.

### 5. Transport matrix stance

The generic socket dial surface accepts an explicit `tls_config_id`, which makes `tls+tcp://` and `wss://` usable through the existing handle model. The stable scheme matrix is documented in `docs/transports.md` and summarized in the README: NNG service/socket surfaces accept NNG schemes, HTTP helper surfaces accept HTTP/HTTPS schemes, synchronous RPC/session helpers route across both families, raw RPC AIO remains NNG-scheme-only, and non-zero TLS handles are accepted only on TLS-capable schemes.

### 6. Final async surface scope

The stable async contract is raw-result-first. NNG/RPC aio helpers collect raw frames through `ducknng_aio_collect(...)`, HTTP aio helpers collect raw HTTP status/header/body rows through `ducknng_ncurl_aio_collect(...)`, and callers explicitly decode frames or bodies afterward. AIO launch timeout bounds one pending operation; `ducknng_aio_collect(..., wait_ms)` and `ducknng_ncurl_aio_collect(..., wait_ms)` only control how long a later collection call waits. Additional structured async wrappers may be added later as convenience APIs, but they are additive and must not become a second background-job or streaming protocol.

### 7. Final type contract stance

The unary Arrow row path now covers the next planned type wave for practical DuckDB tabular values: temporal types, decimals, lists, and structs in addition to the original scalar subset. Before sealing, the remaining type question is whether that documented set is the initial public contract or whether any additional Arrow features, such as map values, dictionary-preserving roundtrips, extension types, or broader deep-nesting guarantees, must land first.

## Strongly recommended before sealing

### 8. Representative protocol examples and tests

The repo now demonstrates req-style RPC, `pair`, `push` / `pull`, `pub` / `sub`, raw aio, unary RPC aio, and the current session control flow. Before sealing, the remaining question is not whether the protocol family is entirely undocumented, but whether the current examples and tests are representative enough for the less-common raw socket patterns that remain open/close-oriented rather than tutorial-driven.

At minimum, the project should keep the existing runnable examples green and decide whether additional tutorial coverage for `bus` or any later event-oriented patterns belongs in the sealed public story.

### 9. Explicit scope for `ws://` and `wss://`

`ws://` and `wss://` are now explicit NNG transport schemes in scope for the public API. What still needs to stay explicit is the boundary: they belong to the NNG transport family, not to the HTTP carrier layer. The HTTP transport contract may still defer browser-style or HTTP-carrier WebSocket work even while NNG WebSocket transports are supported.

## Already addressed in the current pass

These items were worth resolving before the API hardens further and should stay fixed:

- runtime teardown now cleans up services, aio handles, client sockets, TLS configs, the runtime mutex, and the global runtime registry entry instead of leaving destruction partial
- the vendored NNG Windows MinGW fallback is now documented through an explicit local patch file and patch ledger under `patches/nng/`
- README examples now include representative raw protocol slices beyond req/pair, including `push` / `pull`, `pub` / `sub`, and `surveyor` / `respondent`
- the README and `docs/lifetime.md` now make the low-level manual-lifecycle contract explicit instead of implying a nanonext-style GC/finalizer model that DuckDB SQL does not actually provide for user-visible handles
- the unary Arrow row path now includes `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DECIMAL`, `LIST`, and `STRUCT` coverage with SQL-visible regression tests
- query sessions now bind ownership to an explicit `session_token` bearer capability instead of treating `session_id` as a capability
- TLS-authenticated services now attach verified mTLS peer identity to requests and bind sessions to that identity when present
- `ducknng_register_exec_method(true)` can register the opt-in `exec` descriptor with verified peer identity required, while the zero-argument form remains backwards compatible
- `ducknng_set_method_auth(name, requires_auth)` can protect registry-backed methods such as `manifest` using the same descriptor-level auth path
- unregistration now refuses to remove sessionful methods or families while any service has open sessions
- `ducknng_ncurl_aio(...)` now provides the nanonext-style async HTTP client slice and collects through `ducknng_ncurl_aio_collect(...)`
- `ducknng_read_monitor(...)`, `ducknng_monitor_status(...)`, and `ducknng_list_pipes(...)` provide NNG pipe event and active-pipe telemetry
- `src/ducknng_sql_api.c` has been split into focused SQL registration modules and is now only the top-level registration orchestrator
- lifecycle tests cover stopping services with live sessions and rejecting same-service stop while a service-owned SQL authorizer request is active
- unsupported URL schemes and supplied TLS configuration on non-TLS schemes have regression coverage across the major client/helper families
- fetched Arrow IPC session payloads are decoded through `ducknng_parse_body(payload, 'application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream')`, with regression coverage in the session smoke test
- `docs/security.md` now states that arbitrary SQL execution is a deployment-owned capability, not an automatic sandbox, and names recommended exposure profiles plus the internal SQL-injection boundary
- the transport matrix is documented in `docs/transports.md` and summarized in the README, including which schemes accept TLS handles and which surfaces reject the other family
- the async contract is raw-result-first: NNG/RPC aio returns frames, HTTP aio returns HTTP-shaped rows, and structured async wrappers are optional future conveniences

## Not sealing blockers by themselves

These are still important, but they do not need to be finished before the API can be considered sealed if the above items are settled:

- user-defined codec registration hooks beyond the current built-in body codec providers
- scalarfs-style in-memory filesystem/provider research for CSV/TSV/Parquet body parsing, because the generic `body BLOB` fallback is an acceptable stable behavior until a clean provider exists
- a future DuckDB-native Arrow re-plumb, if one ever becomes viable without unstable or deprecated APIs
